# Task-9-Descriptive_Statistics_Primer

Project Overview

This project analyzes the Iris dataset using descriptive statistics. The objective is to understand the center, spread, and distribution of important numerical variables.

Dataset

The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers. This project focuses on the following numerical columns:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Objectives

Calculate and interpret the mean.

Calculate and interpret the median.

Identify the mode.

Calculate standard deviation to understand data spread.

Calculate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.

Compare mean and median to identify possible skewness.

Understand the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Python

Pandas

Descriptive Statistics

The following statistics are calculated for each numerical column:

Statistic

Description

Mean

Average value of the observations

Median

Middle value of the observations

Mode

Most frequently occurring value

Standard Deviation

Measures variation around the mean

25th Percentile

Value below which approximately 25% of observations fall

50th Percentile

Median; approximately 50% of observations fall below this value

75th Percentile

Value below which approximately 75% of observations fall

Skewness Interpretation

Mean and median are compared to understand the shape of the distribution:

Mean approximately equal to median: distribution is approximately symmetric.

Mean greater than median: may indicate positive/right skew.

Mean less than median: may indicate negative/left skew.

Mean and median should be interpreted together rather than using either one alone.

Spread Interpretation

Standard deviation indicates how far observations tend to vary from the mean.

Smaller standard deviation indicates values are more concentrated around the mean.

Larger standard deviation indicates greater variation.

The 25th and 75th percentiles can also be used to understand the spread of the middle 50% of observations.

Excel Work

The Excel workbook contains:

Raw Data

Descriptive Statistics

Analysis

Excel formulas such as AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MODE.SNGL, STDEV.S, and PERCENTILE.INC are used to calculate the required statistics.

Python/Pandas

Example Python code:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("Iris.csv")

columns = [
    "SepalLengthCm",
    "SepalWidthCm",
    "PetalLengthCm",
    "PetalWidthCm"
]

print(df[columns].describe())
print(df[columns].mode())

Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this task, the following concepts are understood:

Central tendency

Data variability

Percentiles

Distribution shape

Mean vs. median comparison

Descriptive analysis using Excel and Pandas

Conclusion

Descriptive statistics provide a simple way to summarize a dataset. Mean, median, and mode describe the center of the data, while standard deviation and percentiles help explain its spread. Comparing mean and median also provides a useful indication of possible skewness.
